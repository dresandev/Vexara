# Vexara: Bershka ecommerce clone

Bershka clone implementing the main functionalities such as authentication flow using auth.js, product payment flow using mercadopago, implementing code that can work for production but in the end everything is in development mode despite being deployed in production.
So far there is only one problem that I do not have much control over because the problem occurs in auth.js, I hope it will be solved soon.
